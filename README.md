Horrera Heroes is an inventory application designed to provide easy to use inventory management. The user will be able to check levels, manage items, and receive low inventory notifications through SMS. The app will be initially available as an open-sourced project that will be funded by ads. I will then transition the project to a freemium model. Some premium features will include multi-warehouse support, cloud, user permissions, and enhanced visualization tools. 


I kept users in mind when I was implementing ass, edit, and remove stock items buttons and layout. I wanted the buttons to be easily assessable. I also wanted the user to be able to manually enter in names and quantities. Having a clear home screen allows the user to easily navigate from one feature to another. I also implemented storage of the phone number and SMS authorization in one simple button. 


I used meaningful names when creating variables and classes. I implemented the latest Android APIs to enhance performance and security. The app will be assessable from android 8 up to 15. I organized code modularly so that future upgrades can be done easily and future failures can be fixed quickly. I limited permissions to only what was needed. These strategies will be used in future projects to create better maintainability and scalability while ensuring security. 
For testing I utilized emulators built in Android Studio. I also tested the program on multiple different devices from different manufacturers. These devices also ran on different android versions. I tested every component individually and ensured all permissions were handled securely. 


Some challenges I faced are balancing between open source and monetization. I accomplish this with ads and eventually transitioning to a tiered subscription model for wider appeal. I also had to implement best practices for data security, inventory and user data has to be secured securely. Then lastly you want efficient code to minimize background usage to ensure the app does not drain a deviceâ€™s battery. 


I believe I implemented the SMS notification system extremely well. It double checked to ensure no duplicate data or permissions were created. It even displayed current numbers on file, so that the user knows if they want to update said number.  Horrera Heroes will continue to scale and is setup for future enhancements.
